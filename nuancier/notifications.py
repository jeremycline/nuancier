Dear Madam/Sir,

First of all we would like to thank you for contributing in making Fedora
better by submitting a supplementary wallpaper in Nuancier.

However, we regrets to inform you that your contribution has been rejected
by the administrator for the following reason:

  {0}

This should not discourage you to submit other candidate for this election
or the next one.

Best regards,
The Nuancier administrators team
